## 📚 How to Run the Project

> Each microservice must be started individually after the Config Server and Discovery Server.  
> Use Angular CLI to run the frontend. Ensure MYSQL configurations are accessible.

```bash
# Start Config Server
cd config-server
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Start Eureka Discovery Server
cd discovery-server
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Start Gateway
cd gateway-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Start each microservice (example)
cd user-service
./mvnw spring-boot:run

# Frontend (Angular 19)
cd frontend
npm install
ng serve
